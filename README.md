# _Tools

A collection of digital tools/libraries/frameworks for building and prototyping

### A note on syntax:
tools.md is a Markdown file. Markdown is a simplified rich document
syntax that produces HTML. 
See [Daring Fireball's Markdown
guide](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for more info
on syntax.

Pro tip: press *m* on your keyboard for a cheat sheet.

### The important stuff:
Precede list items with `* `, such as:
```
* list item 1
* list item 2
* list item 3
```

Headings are preceded by `#`. The more `#`'s you use, the smaller the
heading.

Links are formatted `[link text](link url)`.
